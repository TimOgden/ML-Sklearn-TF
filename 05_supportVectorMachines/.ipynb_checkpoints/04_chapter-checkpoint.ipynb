The idea of fitting the widest street allows for the best separation between the classes.\n",

    "Strictly forcing all positive instances to be off the street and on the right side is called a **hard margin**. The issue with  this kind of classification is that it is super susceptible to outliers and that it will only work if the data is linearly seperable.\n",
    "\n",
