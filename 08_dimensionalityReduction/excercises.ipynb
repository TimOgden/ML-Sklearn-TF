    "\"Apart from speeding up training, dimensionality reduction is also extremely useful for data visualization.\" As humans that live in a universe composed of 3 spatial dimensions, we have a lot of difficulty visualizing data that goes beyond the 3 dimensions. For example, something like an MNIST image will have 28\\*28=784 dimensions which can't be plotted on a graph with just two or three axes. Reducing dimensionality will both speed up the training process and also "
