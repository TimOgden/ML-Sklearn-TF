    "**1. What are the main motivations for reducing a dataset's dimensionality? What are the main drawbacks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Apart from speeding up training, dimensionality reduction is also extremely useful for data visualization.\" As humans that live in a universe composed of 3 spatial dimensions, we have a lot of difficulty visualizing data that goes beyond the 3 dimensions. For example, something like an MNIST image will have 28\\*28=784 dimensions which can't be plotted on a graph with just two or three axes. Reducing dimensionality will both speed up the training process and also make it possible (in most cases) to plot your data and make it readable to humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for drawbacks, it's impossible to reduce a dataset's dimensionality without some loss, and thus will \"make your system perform slightly worse.\" The book also makes the case that \"it also makes your pipelines a bit more complex and thus harder to maintain,\" and while I think it's a valid point, I can't imagine that being anything beyond fairly trivial work."

    "**2. What is the curse of dimensionality? **\n",
    "The curse of dimensionality is the accumulation of all the issues that arise from dealing with high-dimensional data. The inability to visualize or conceptualize, but also the fact that \"high-dimensional datasets are at risk of being very sparse.\" This means that two instances of data are much more likely to be far away from eachother than in a low-dimensional dataset. This will increase the likelihood of overfitting."

    "Theoretically, yes. In the kPCA algorithm example, we used the inverse transform function to reconstruct the dataset and evaluate the loss function compared to the original dataset. However, there will be a lot of loss, and the reconstruction will be nowhere near perfect.\n",

    "\n",
    "However, if your dataset is larger than your memory, you can use Incremental PCA, which will take batches of data and partially fit the principal components. \n",
    "\n",

So if you wanted to turn a 10,000-dimensional dataset into a 2-dimensional dataset (for whatever reason), you would run a lot faster using Randomized PCA.\n",

    "Perhaps the easiest way is to reduce your dataset (or a subset of your dataset), and then run that reduced set through the `inverse_transform` function to return the dataset back to its original dimensionality. Then, you can use mean squared error or mean absolute error or whatever loss function you want to evaluate how much value was lost."

    "I suppose you could, maybe for example use LLE to unfold a twisted Manifold will result in the Manifold being unwrapped but still existing in 3 dimensional space on a plane not parallel to any of the standard planes. Then PCA would be good for defining two principle components to find the ideal plane to project the instances onto. Would this be better than just using one LLE algorithm to go from n dimensions to 2 dimensions? That would have to be tested on your dataset."
